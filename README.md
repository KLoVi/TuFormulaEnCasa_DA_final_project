# TuFórmulaEnCasa_final_project

This project undertakes the exploration of previously unused data from a small veterinary business in Colombia, collected through a dedicated software for veterinary services (https://okvet.co/#).

The business operates in two main areas: veterinary services (referred to as "En Casa") and the sale of medications (termed "Tu Fórmula en Casa"). For veterinary services, data were provided in six raw Excel datasets from the OKVET software, encapsulating varied information on appointments, consultations, deworming, laboratory tests, medical prescriptions, vaccinations, and surgeries. Conversely, the nascent arm of the business—medication sales to clients is in its development phase, with data manually compiled into a raw Excel file detailing product information, purchases, sales, inventory, and more. The data across these domains were found to be non-standardized, necessitating significant cleaning and wrangling for comprehensive analysis.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze data of prescribed medications from the past year to forecast inventory needs for the forthcoming year, predicated on the assumption of consistent trends. Additionally, it aims to assess medication purchase patterns by clients over the last five months —the extent of available data—to identify potential areas for sales growth.

To synthesise the results, three dashboards will be developed for "Tu Fórmula en Casa": 
1. A sales dashboard showing the actual results in terms of sales for the period of available data.
2. A comparative dashboard between the prescribed products (the sales potential) and the actual sales, by type of product sold.
3. An inventory management dashboard, designed to streamline purchasing planning and recommend products based on historical data of sales and prescribed medicines.

Beyond the data analysis, the project includes recommendations for improving data storage practices and identifying opportunities to enhance business growth.
